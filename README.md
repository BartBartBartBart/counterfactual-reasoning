# robust-analogy
Code associated with the paper "Evaluating the Robustness of Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models"

Code and data for each experiment -- letterstring, digit matrix, and story analogies -- is located in individual directories. Each directory has its own README with details on how to run the code.

Code for letterstring and digit matrix experiments is based on [https://github.com/taylorwwebb/emergent_analogies_LLM/tree/main]
