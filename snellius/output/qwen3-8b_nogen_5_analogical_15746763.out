Full Qwen output: **Exemplars:**

1. **Pattern based on letter repetition and sequence:**  
   Example: [a a b b c c] [a a b b]  
   This exemplifies a pattern where pairs of letters repeat, and the second half is a shortened version of the first.

2. **Pattern based on alphabetical order (in a known sequence):**  
   Example: [a b c d] [a b c]  
   This exemplifies a pattern where the first half is a sequence of letters in order, and the second half is the same sequence truncated.

3. **Pattern based on letter substitution or transformation:**  
   Example: [x y z] [w v u]  
   This exemplifies a pattern where the second half is a reverse or transformed version of the first.

2. **Pattern based on letter repetition and sequence:**  
   Example: [a a b b c c] [a a b b]  
   This exemplar uses a repeating pattern of two identical letters followed by the next letter, and then shortens the sequence.

3. **Pattern based on letter shifting (e.g., Caesar cipher):**  
   Example: [d e f g] [d e f]  
   This exemplar uses a shifted alphabet and follows a similar structure to the original problem, with a decreasing length in each group.

The first group is [k a p q o], and the second group is [a k p q o], which is a rotation (shift) of the first group. The same pattern applies to the second pair: [j i r l m] → [?]. Rotating the first group [j i r l m] by one position to the left gives [i r l m j]. However, the pattern seems to be a shift to the right, as [k a p q o] → [a k p q o] (shift right by one).

Use the following alphabet to guess the missing piece.

n b c d e f g h i j r l m a k p q o s t u v w x y z

Note that the alphabet may be in an unfamiliar order. Complete the pattern using this order. Provide only the answer between double brackets.

[b f d e c] [b c d e f]
[n b e d c] [ ? ]

First, describe 3 relevant exemplars that are distinct from this problem. Then give the final answer. Answer with only the examples and the final answer. Put your final answer between double brackets.


--- TARGET LETTERS ---

['n', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
Full Qwen output: **Exemplars:**

1. [a b c] [b c a] – This pattern shows a rotation of the first three letters, with the second group being a reversed version of the first.
2. [x y z] [z y x] – Similar to the first example, this shows a reversal of the first three letters in the second group.
3. [m n o] [o n m] – Again, a reversal pattern between the two groups.

**Final Answer:**  
[[n b e d c]]
Filtered response: n b e d c
