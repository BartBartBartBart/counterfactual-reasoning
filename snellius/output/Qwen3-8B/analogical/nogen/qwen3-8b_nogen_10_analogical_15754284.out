['x', 'n', 'h', 'p', 'q']
Full Qwen output: **Exemplars:**

1. **[a b c] [b c a]** – This pattern shows a rotation of the first three letters, with the second group being a cyclic shift of the first.
2. **[d e f g] [g f e d]** – This is a reversal pattern, where the second group is the reverse of the first.
3. **[m n o p] [o p m n]** – This pattern involves a shift of the first two elements to the end, creating a circular permutation.
