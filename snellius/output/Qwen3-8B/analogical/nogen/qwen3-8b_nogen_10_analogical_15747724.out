1. **Pattern based on letter position in a standard alphabet:**  
   Example: A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, Q, S, U, W, Y  
   This pattern follows every second letter in the standard English alphabet.

2. **Pattern based on alternating sequences:**  
   Example: [A, B, C], [D, E, F], [G, H, I]  
   This pattern divides the alphabet into groups of three letters, repeating the sequence.

3. **Pattern based on reverse alphabetical order:**  
   Example: Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N

['o', 'p', 'h', 'n', 's']
Full Qwen output: **Exemplars:**

1. **[a b c] [a b c d]** – This exemplifies a pattern where the second group is the first group extended by one additional character in the sequence.
2. **[x y z] [x y z a]** – Similar to the first, but with a wrap-around or cycle, where the sequence continues from the beginning after reaching the end.
3. **[m n o] [m n o p]** – Demonstrates a pattern of sequential addition, where each group is the previous group with one more character added in order.

**Final Answer:**  
[[o p h n s]]
Filtered response: o p h n s

['i', 't', 'k', 'z', 'm']
Full Qwen output: **Exemplars:**

1. **[a b c] [a b c d]** – This pattern shows a sequence increasing by one letter in each subsequent group, following a linear progression.
2. **[x y z] [x y z a]** – Similar to the first example, but using a different starting point and wrapping around the alphabet (assuming a circular order).
3. **[m n o p] [m n o p q]** – This exemplifies a pattern where each group adds one more letter in sequence, maintaining a consistent increment.

**Final Answer:**  
[[i t k z a]]
