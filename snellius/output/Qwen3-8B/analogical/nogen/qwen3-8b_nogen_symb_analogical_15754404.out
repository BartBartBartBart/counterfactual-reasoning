1. **Pattern Recognition in Sequences:** Given a sequence of symbols or characters, identify the underlying pattern or rule that governs the sequence. For example:  
   `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`  
   This is a simple alphabetical sequence, and the pattern is the natural order of the English alphabet.

2. **Symbolic Logic Puzzles:** These involve interpreting a set of symbols as a language or code, and using logical deduction to determine the missing element. For example:  
   `+ = -`  
   `* = /`  
   `? = ?`  
   Here, the pattern is that the first symbol represents the second symbol, and the task is to determine what the question mark represents.
