1. **Pattern based on letter position in a standard alphabet:**  
   Example: [a b c d] [a b c]  
   This uses the standard English alphabet order and follows a pattern of decreasing length.

2. **Pattern based on letter repetition and sequence:**  
   Example: [a a b b c c] [a a b b]  
   This uses a repeating pattern of pairs, decreasing in length.

3. **Pattern based on letter shifting:**  
   Example: [a b c d] [b c d e]  
   This uses a shifting pattern where each subsequent group starts one letter later in the alphabet.
