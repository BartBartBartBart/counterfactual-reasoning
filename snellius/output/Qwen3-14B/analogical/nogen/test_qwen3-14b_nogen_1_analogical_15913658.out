Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

=== PROMPT ===

Use the following alphabet to guess the missing piece.

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

Note that the alphabet may be in an unfamiliar order. Complete the pattern using this order.

[e f g h] [e f g i]
[f g h i] [ ? ]

First, describe 3 relevant exemplars that are distinct from this problem. Then give the final answer. Answer with only the examples and the final answer. Put your final answer between double brackets.


--- TARGET LETTERS ---

['f', 'g', 'h', 'j']
The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_k']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
