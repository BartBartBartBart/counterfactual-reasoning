The pattern appears to be that the second group is the first group with the letters shifted in the given alphabet. Let's determine the shift.

First group: [e c d u f]  
Second group: [u c d e f]

Looking at the positions in the given alphabet:

Given alphabet: a u c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t b v w x y z

Let's find the positions of the letters in the first group:  
- e is at position 4  
- c is at position 2  
- d is at position 3  
- u is at position 1  
- f is at position 5

Now the second group:  
- u is at position 1  
- c is at position 2  
- d is at position 3  
- e is at position 4  
- f is at position 5

So the second group is the first group with the letters shifted forward by 3 positions (e → u, c → d, d → e, u → f, f → g). Wait, this doesn't match. Let's check again.

Actually, the second
